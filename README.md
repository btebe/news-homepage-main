## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt a cool trick to not apply css to two different elements at the same time.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.new-section > *:not(:first-child):not(:last-child)::after {
}
```

### Continued development

Persevering to develope my css skills. My goal is to build a strong foundation to develop my skills on.

### Useful resources
